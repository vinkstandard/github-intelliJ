//        Write a method that takes a field for well-known board game "Battleship" as an argument and returns true if it has a valid disposition of ships,
//        false otherwise. Argument is guaranteed to be 10*10 two-dimension array.
//
//        Elements in the array are numbers, 0 if the cell is free and 1 if occupied by ship.
//        Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players.
//        Each player has a 10x10 grid containing several "ships" and objective is to destroy enemy's forces by targetting individual cells on his field.
//        The ship occupies one or more cells in the grid. Size and number of ships may differ from version to version.
//        In this kata we will use Soviet/Russian version of the game.
//
//        Before the game begins, players set up the board and place the ships accordingly to the following rules:
//        There must be single battleship (size of 4 cells), 2 cruisers (size 3), 3 destroyers (size 2) and 4 submarines (size 1).
//        Any additional ships are not allowed, as well as missing ships.
//        Each ship must be a straight line, except for submarines, which are just single cell.
